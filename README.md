# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
The "Number Guessing Game" project was developed as part of the first semester in the BS CyberSecurity program. It serves as an introduction to programming fundamentals, including variables, conditionals, and loops. The game prompts players to guess a randomly generated number within set parameters, providing feedback based on their guesses. Through input validation and user interaction, the project aims to foster problem-solving skills and engage users in a fun and accessible way. It serves as a gateway to software development, laying the foundation for future programming endeavors.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: Generates a random number within specified parameters.
- **User Input**: Prompts users to input their guesses and validates the input.
- **Feedback**: Provides feedback to users based on their guesses (e.g., too high, too low, correct).
- **Looping**: Utilizes loops to allow multiple guesses until the correct number is guessed.
- **Accessibility**: Accessible and easy to understand for users of all skill levels.
- **Engagement**: Engages users through interactive gameplay and feedback mechanisms.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project files in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the project's main file (e.g., `number_guessing_game.py`) to start the game.
4. Follow the prompts to guess the randomly generated number.
5. Enjoy playing and improving your problem-solving skills!

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the instructors and mentors at Sindh Madressatul Islam University for their guidance and support throughout the first semester of the BS CyberSecurity program. This project has provided me with valuable hands-on experience in programming fundamentals and has laid the groundwork for my journey in cybersecurity and software development.
